# COMP6841 Something Awesome Project

For my Something Awesome project I've created a novelty chrome extension that doubles as a keylogger / user data collector. 

There are two main parts to the project, the user-facing novelty aspect and the hidden malicious aspect. 

## Novelty (Social Engineering)
The goal of this section is to demonstrate a use-case by which a user would be willing to give a chrome extension full browser permissions. As an asynchronous social engineering attack, the premise of the extensions aims to convince the user to provide this permission. 

This extension claims it's sole purpose is replacing a list of basic ASCII smileys on any websites visited by the user with their unicode emoji replacements.

## Malicious (Keylogger & Data Collection Server)
The goal of this section is to harvest user keystrokes and form input, and have this data be sent to a remote server, where it can be categorised and stored, such that multiple victims of the attack can be tracked easily.
