# COMP6841 Something Awesome Project

For my Something Awesome project I've created a novelty chrome extension that doubles as a keylogger / user data collector. 

There are two main parts to the project, the user-facing novelty aspect and the hidden malicious aspect. 

## Novelty (Social Engineering)
The goal of this section is to demonstrate a use-case by which a user would be willing to give a chrome extension full browser permissions. As an asynchronous social engineering attack, I will convince the user to provide this permission through claiming to just replace a list of ASCII smileys (Such as :), :D, :( ), on any websites visited by the user, with their unicode emoji replacements.

## Malicious (Keylogger & Data Collection Server)
The goal of this section is to harvest user keystrokes and form input, and have this data be sent to a remote server, where it can be categorised and stored, such that multiple victims of the attack can be tracked easily.
